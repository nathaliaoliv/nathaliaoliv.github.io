	<p><strong>Oliveira's Family Recipes</strong> shares traditional family recipes as well as our family's favorite easy recipes. 
	We are a Brazilian family living in the USA. Therefore,
you can find everything from Brazilian to American recipes. 
Also, since we have been living in the US for five years, the ingredient list is adapted to what can be found in US grocery stores. </p>

	<p>The love of cooking has been in my family for many generations. We use these recipes daily in our house, some were passed down from our grandparents 
	or our parents, they have been tested and improved over many years and without a doubt they have a delicious flavor. Creating a website with these 
	recipes helps us conveniently view them and share them with our friends, family an our  future generations. 
	Thanks for visiting <em>Oliveira's Family Recipes</em>.</p>
