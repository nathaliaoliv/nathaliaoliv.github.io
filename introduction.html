              <li>Personal background: I am from Brazil. I lived in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil for 23 years, where I graduated as an Environmental Engineer from the Centro Universitario de Belo Horizonte. 
                  After graduating I decided to come to the USA to learn English and improve my job and career opportunities. After learning enough English to study other subjects I saw a great opportunity in the Information Technology 
                  field as it is in high demand everywhere in the world.</li>
              <li>Professional Background: My first job was a front desk receptionist in a gym. After that I worked as an Early childhood Educator for 2 years. Also as a Math tutor teacher in a public school for 1 and a half years. 
                  Then, I worked as an environmental intern in an electromechanical and hydraulic company. After moving to the USA I worked as a nanny for 2 years which helped improve my English skills. </li>
              <li>Academic Background: BA in Environmental Engineering from Centro Universitario de Belo Horizonte, completed in July 2017. Communication and marketing coordinator of the organizing committee of the 
                National Meeting of Environmental Engineering Students (ENEEAmb) & Brazilian Symposium on Engineering and Sustainability 2017. I am currently enrolled in the Information Technology Database Development/ Business Intelligence AAS at CPCC,
                this is my last semester. </li>
              <li>Background in this Subject: I have no previous knowledge in building websites, my program at CPCC was all about databases and programming so far. I am excited and a little scared for this class. </li>
              <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10 </li>
              <li>Courses I'm in & Why:
                <ul>
                  <li>WEB250 - Database-Driven websites - This course is a substitute for my Capstone class. (I am a little scared of this course, but I am willing to do my best).</li>
                  <li>DBA 220 - Oracle DB Programming II - This course is required for my program.</li>
                  <li>CTS 225 Spreadsheet Data Analysis - I believe this content is relevant and can help me in my career goals.</li>
                  <li>CTS 230 Advanced Spreadsheet - I have done the basic Spreadsheet class and I believe that advanced spreadsheet knowledge is very relevant in the IT field.</li>
                </ul>  
              </li>
              <li>Funny/Interesting Item about Yourself: Portuguese is my first language. Brazilians do not speak Spanish as many people think. We were colonized by Portugal and our first and basically the only language spoken in Brazil is Portuguese.</li> 
              <li>I'd also like to Share: I hope we all have a great semester!</li>
