   <li><b> Personal background:</b> I was born and raised in Brazil in the state of Minas Gerais, known for its beautiful mountains, waterfalls and delicious typical cuisine. I graduated as an Environmental Engineer at a renowned University in my hometown and then decided to come to the United States to learn English to improve my professional opportunities. After a year of studying English, I decided to change course and explore the world of IT, which despite being challenging, I really like and want to build my career in this field. Here in the United States I got married and had my first daughter, who is now 2 years old and is a sweet, smart and adventurous little girl.</li>

    <li><b>Professional:</b> I worked as an attendant at a gym for 2 years where, in addition to greeting visitors and members, I was responsible for entering data into a Gym Management Software and excel spreadsheets. I also worked as an early childhood education teacher for a year and a half while I was in college. In addition, I interned at an electromechanical and hydraulic company in the environmental area, where I consolidated my knowledge about pollutant control and the disposal and reuse of the company's solid waste, in addition to processes of the Environmental Management System (EMS). In addition, I had the opportunity to develop skills such as oratory by giving lectures to stakeholders.</li>

But, I'm here to prove to myself that I can learn this.</li>
